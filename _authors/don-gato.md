Top Cat (or simply T.C.) is the yellow-furred, suave, and cheeky-chappy main character of the series. He wears a purple pork pie hat and a matching waistcoat. He often manipulates or tricks others, mainly Officer Dibble, but even his own gang. He does appreciate the effort the gang does for him, but he often takes credit for it. That said, he is caring toward to the gang and will help one of them if they need it. He also stops Officer Dibble from arresting him by lying to Dibble about how much talent Dibble has.
