Himachal Pradesh introduces the Himcare Scheme for jail inmates, with the objective of providing them with access to high-quality healthcare. The initiative aims to cover the cost of premiums for inmates, easing their financial burden during their time in prison. The launch also included the Integrated STI, HIV, TB, Hepatitis (ISHTH) campaign, which will screen and treat inmates across the state.
