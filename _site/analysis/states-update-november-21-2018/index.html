    <p><strong>Big News</strong></p>

<p>Great Eastern Energy Corporation announces it has found prospective shale resources with a valuation of over $2.78 billion at its Raniganj (South) block in West Bengal; Odisha releases its ‘Biotech Policy 2018’ at the Make in Odisha Conclave; six north-eastern states agree to implement the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA); Maharashtra signs an MOU with NITI Aayog and the Wadhwani AI group to launch the International Center for Transformational Artificial Intelligence focusing on the rural healthcare; and more.</p>

<p><strong>Center – State relations</strong></p>

<p>Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri warned states against tweaking rules of the center’s Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA), asserting that doing so will lead to “harsh consequences.” He went on to say that the “full benefit” of the Real Estate Regulatory Act (RERA) will be realized only when its provision is implemented in letter and spirit. <strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/govt-says-won-t-amend-any-rera-provision-warns-states-against-tweaking-law-118111500966_1.html">Business Standard</a> <strong>In detail:</strong> <a href="http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/RSBillTexts/PassedRajyaSabha/realest-238-RSP-E.pdf">The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA)</a></p>

<p>Six northeastern states – Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, and Sikkim – have finally agreed to implement the RERA. The development comes after a team from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs visited the northeastern states and discussed the issues coming in the way of implementing the act.  <strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.nagalandpost.com/nagaland-also-agrees-to-implement-real-estate-regulation-act/185336.html">Nagaland Post</a> <strong>In detail:</strong> <a href="http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/RSBillTexts/PassedRajyaSabha/realest-238-RSP-E.pdf">The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA)</a></p>

<p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed three loan agreements with the government to provide a loan of $574 million to support three initiatives.
