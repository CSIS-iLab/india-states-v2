My recent journey through 11 of India’s 29 states, speaking with senior power officials, confirms that India has made incredible progress in tackling its power generation deficit. Increased generation capacity through new additions of renewables and greater efficiency and reliability of coal stocks for thermal power plants is coupling with the success of India’s incredible demand-side measures to create a perfect storm of plentiful power. However, the next set of problems for its power sector are in some ways more difficult to confront. To address those problems, India will have to employ a diverse and creative set of solutions."

States have taken up the baton, working hard to outdo each other in governance reforms. Every three months, the CSIS Wadhwani Chair in U.S.-India Policy prepares an overview of key state-level reforms from India’s twenty-nine states as well as Delhi and Puducherry (which have their own legislatures). In the first quarter of 2017, 1 January through 31 March, the total number of significant positive state-level reforms rose to 20, compared to fourteen in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>\n"
