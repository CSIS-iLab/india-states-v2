title: Uttar Pradesh approves multiple policy proposals.  According to new
  rules, only 1% stamp duty will be levied on registrations of property owned by
  women, thereby easing the financial burden on women buyers.   The state also
  issues directions that women associated with the Centre’s Bima Sakhi scheme
  can now earn up to $80.9 per month. Under this scheme, women working as Life
  Insurance Corporation (LIC) agents will receive a monthly stipend plus
  commission for the first three years of service. This financial support
  encourages women to become self-reliant while also promoting insurance
