Rajasthan launches a novel digital water distribution system for agricultural fields Sriganganagar district to facilitate the supply of irrigation water on a predetermined schedule. The new system developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Jaipur, aims to enable the farmers to know of the status of water reaching their fields and minimise the scope for human error often reported in the manual system.
