Uttar Pradesh announces the Uttar Pradesh Nazul Properties (Management and Utilization for Public Purposes) Ordinance, 2024 to ensure that government-owned land earmarked for public use is not given to private individuals or entities on free hold. This move is intended to ensure that public land, is reclaimed by the government, and exclusively allocated for public projects once the lease period expires.
