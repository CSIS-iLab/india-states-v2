**Tamil Nadu** launches the **Tamil Nadu Self Certification Scheme**. Under the scheme, plots on approved layouts, layouts covered under the 2017 regularisation scheme, and plots registered by a deed before October 20, 2016, are eligible for self-certification of residential buildings in urban areas. The plots eligible for self-certification will be exempted from paying certification fees and will not require clearances from the state government.
