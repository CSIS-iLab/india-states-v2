NITI Aayog releases the National Multidimensional Poverty Index: A Progress of Review 2023, which is a composite measure of multidimensional poverty that counts factors beyond money, including education, health, and living standards. The index estimates that 135 million Indians exited multidimensional poverty between 2015 and 2021, with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP) together accounting for 56.8 million.
