Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) announces the generic tariff for net-meter consumers in Maharashtra for the year 2023-24. The commission has set the tariff at $0.0369 per unit, allowing solar rooftop prosumers using net meters to sell their surplus solar energy to local discoms at this rate. The newly established tariff closely aligns with the earlier rate of $0.0369-0.0375 per unit determined under the PM-KUSUM scheme.
