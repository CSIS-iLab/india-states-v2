Odisha extends the command area development and water management scheme for five years from 2024-25 to 2028-29. The scheme with an outlay of $91.6 million will support construction of a field channel network of 2,400 km on 80,000 hectare of command area. Once constructed, the field channel network will ensure equitable distribution of available irrigation water up to the tail end to reduce the gap between irrigation potential created and utilised.
