Reserve Bank of India releases a study stating that five states — Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra,and Karnataka — accounted for 57.2 percent share ($24 billion in total project cost) of the total bank-assisted investment proposals made during the year 2022-23. This is higher than the states’ 43.2 percent share during 2021-22. This indicates a skewed industrialisation pattern in the country.
