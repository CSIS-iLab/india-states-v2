Chhattisgarh introduces the new Rules for Green Energy Open Access to promote renewable energy adoption in the state. The notification brings several key changes including the reduction of the minimum capacity eligible for Open Access from 500 kW to 100 kW, effective from 1st September 2023. This reduction opens the doors for a broader range of consumers to opt for green energy sources and contribute to sustainable practices.
