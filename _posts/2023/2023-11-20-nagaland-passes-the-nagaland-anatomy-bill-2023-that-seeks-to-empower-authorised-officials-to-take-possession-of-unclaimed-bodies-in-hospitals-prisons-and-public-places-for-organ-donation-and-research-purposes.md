Nagaland passes the Nagaland Anatomy Bill, 2023 that seeks to empower authorised officials to take possession of unclaimed bodies in hospitals, prisons, and public places for organ donation, and research purposes. The bill will also enable people to donate their body organs after death once they submit written intentions in front of witnesses.
