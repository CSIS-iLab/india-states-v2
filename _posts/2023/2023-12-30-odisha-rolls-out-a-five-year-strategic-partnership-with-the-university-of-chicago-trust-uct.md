Odisha rolls out a five-year strategic partnership with the University of Chicago Trust (UCT) for using data to advance innovations and drive policy decisions. Earlier in January this year, they had signed a MoU to establish the Data, Policy, and Innovation Centre (DPIC), that will support evidence-based research in areas of energy and environment, health, education, agriculture and water and sanitation.
