Uttar Pradesh approves the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Policy that aims to provide incentives to overseas investors, including exemptions in land acquisition, stamp duty, capital investment, and 100 percent electricity duty exemption for five years. The policy will also allow area-specific exemptions in stamp duty and registration fees in line with the Uttar Pradesh Industrial Investment and Employment Promotion Policy-2022.
