Maharashtra cabinet approves the Integrated and Sustainable Textile Policy for 2023–2028 with a goal of creating 500,000 jobs in the industry during that time. The objective of this policy is to increase cotton’s processing potential to 80% from its current 30%, and lure in investments worth $3 billion. The policy also plans to establish a state textile corporation – The Maharashtra State Textile Development Corporation (MSTDC) – for supporting schemes for the sector and develop six textile parks throughout the state.
