title: Uttar Pradesh approves new Stamp Duty charges. The state approves a
  maximum charge of $56.68 (INR 5,000) for stamp duty and registration fees on
  property partition deeds. Previously, property partitions attracted 4 percent
  stamp duty and 1 percent registration fees on the property’s value, which
  discouraged families from officially recording property partitions in
  municipal records. The new provision is expected to reduce litigation,
  facilitate amicable settlements, update land and revenue records, and make
  properties more easily available for sale.
