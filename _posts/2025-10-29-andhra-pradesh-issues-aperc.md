Kerala standardizes Working Hours for Hospitals. The new working hours of employees, including nurses, in all private hospitals across the state will be aligned with government-operated hospital shift systems. The Labor Department mandates a 6-6-12 hour shift system for all staﬀ, irrespective of the number of beds in a hospital. Employees working beyond their shift hours are entitled to overtime pay, applicable for up to 208 hours per month. Previously, the shift system applied only to private hospitals with more than 100 beds, with 6-hour day shifts and 12-hour night shifts.
