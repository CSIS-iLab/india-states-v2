Central Electricity Authority (CEA) releases Guidelines for Slope Stability for Hydro Power Projects in the aftermath of the Sikkim floods which impacted hydro power projects of over 2,000MW in the state. The guidelines aim to take into consideration past slope failures and the existence of unstable slopes in the project area and recommend necessary remedial measures for slope stabilization of hydro power projects prior to construction, during construction, and post-commissioning of the project.
