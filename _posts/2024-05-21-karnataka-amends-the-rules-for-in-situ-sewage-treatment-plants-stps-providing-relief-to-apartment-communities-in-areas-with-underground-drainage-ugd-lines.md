Karnataka amends the rules for in-situ sewage treatment plants (STPs), providing relief to apartment communities in areas with underground drainage (UGD) lines. As per the amendment, only apartment complexes with over 120 units and producing over 80 kilolitres (KLD) of sewage per day will have to install an in-situ STP. At present, an STP is mandatory for projects above 50 units. However, in areas yet to be serviced by UGD lines, an in-situ STP is mandatory for all projects with over 20 units.
