title: "Tamil Nadu launches the “Kalaignar Kaivinai Thittam (KKT)”, an artisan
  development scheme supporting 25 traditional crafts through financial aid,
  skill development, and entrepreneurship training. Artisans can access loans up
  to $3,600, with a 25 percent capital subsidy (capped at $600) and an interest
  subsidy of up to 5 percent. Unlike the centre’s Vishwakarma Yojana, the KKT
  removes caste criteria and raises the minimum eligible age to 35. The scheme
  also includes $600,000 for infrastructure upgrades in Kancheepuram and
  enhances Geographical Indication (GI) subsidies to $1,200. "
