title: "Andhra Pradesh approves the Minor Mineral Policy, 2025 to revive the
  mining sector and support MSMEs. The policy reintroduces application-based
  leases for granite and building materials, while industrial minerals will
  follow a production- linked auction model. Over 6,000 pending lease
  applications will be processed on a first-come basis. The policy revokes the
  2021 consideration amount, reduces lease premiums, rationalizes penalties
  through a one-time settlement scheme, and introduces a clear, tonnage-based
  fee structure. "
