Andhra Pradesh approves Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for online Change of Land Use (CLU) Permissions. The new SOP, under the Andhra Pradesh Development Permission Management System (APDPMS) 2.0 aims to enhance the ease of doing business across the state. The new framework enables individuals, developers, and institutions to apply online for land conversions, such as agricultural to residential or residential to commercial, through a fully digital, paperless process governed by a strict 45-day Service Level Agreement (SLA).
