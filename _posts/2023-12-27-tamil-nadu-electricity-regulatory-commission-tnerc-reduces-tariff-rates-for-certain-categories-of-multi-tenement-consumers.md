Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) reduces tariff rates for certain categories of multi-tenement consumers and waives peak hour charges for specific industries until the installation of smart meters by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Ltd. (TANGEDCO). Additionally, TNERC also reduces the solar rooftop network charges by 50 percent for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) industries.
