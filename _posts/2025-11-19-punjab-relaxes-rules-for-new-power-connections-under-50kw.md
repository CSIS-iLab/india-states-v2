title: " Punjab relaxes Rules for New Power Connections under 50kW. The new
  simplified procedure ensures that applicants will no longer be required to
  submit a test report from a licensed electrical contractor or provide
  self-certification for wiring at their premises. Instead, a declaration within
  the online application form, confirming the internal wiring at the premises
  was executed and tested by a licensed electrical contractor or designated
  government officer and that a test certificate is available with the
  applicant, will suffice."
