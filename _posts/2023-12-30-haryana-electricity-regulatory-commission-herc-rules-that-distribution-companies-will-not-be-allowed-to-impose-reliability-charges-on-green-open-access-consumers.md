Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) rules that distribution companies will not be allowed to impose reliability charges on green open access consumers due to the lack of a defined clause in the Green Energy Open Access Regulations, 2023. The ruling comes in response to a petition seeking amendment in the provisions of the Renewable Energy Regulations 2021 to ensure it is consistent with the Ministry of Powerâ€™s Green Energy Open Access Regulations 2022.
