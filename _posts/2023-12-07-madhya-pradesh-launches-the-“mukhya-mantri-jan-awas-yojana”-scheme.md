Madhya Pradesh launches the “Mukhya Mantri Jan Awas Yojana” scheme to provide free houses for the homeless people in the state. The scheme aims to provide housing for the people who have been left out of the two national housing schemes, i.e., the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and the Awas Plus scheme.
