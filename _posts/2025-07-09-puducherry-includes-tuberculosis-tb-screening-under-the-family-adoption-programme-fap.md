title: Puducherry includes tuberculosis (TB) screening under the Family Adoption
  Programme (FAP). This is first-of-a-kind low cost model for screening of TB
  and can   be scaled in regions where there is scarcity of resources. Under the
  FAP, MBBS students during their routine visits to allotted families, screen
  the members for symptoms suggestive of TB and use a novel tool to assess the
  vulnerability status of the members for TB.
