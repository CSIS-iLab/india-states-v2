Uttarakhand approves the Uttarakhand Clean Mobility Transformation Policy, 2024 to enhance urban transportation and combat vehicular air pollution from outdated diesel vehicle in the state. As a pilot project, the policy will roll out in Dehradun before extending to other regions of the state and will swap diesel buses and three-wheeler tempos with CNG and other eco-friendly alternatives.
