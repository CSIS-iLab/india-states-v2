title: Karnataka caps Medical Deputations. The state imposes a cap on how long
  doctors and staﬀ from the Health Department can stay on deputation in medical
  colleges, corporations, or other agencies. The change in policy stems from
  concerns that large-scale deputations are leading to staﬀ shortages in
  government hospitals. Under the new   rules, Group A officers can serve a
  maximum of three years, Group B for four years, Group C for five years, and
  Group D for seven years.
