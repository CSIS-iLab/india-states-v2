title: Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) issues a clarification
  stating that if additional solar or wind capacity is added to an existing
  co-located wind-solar hybrid power project, transmission charges will not
  exceed the capacity contracted with the transmission licensee, provided the
  total installed capacity is within the contracted limits. If the new solar or
  wind capacity exceeds the existing contracted transmission capacity, then the
  charges will be based on the higher of the two capacities, subject to
  evacuation approval for the additional capacity.
