  Conditions for Open Access Regulations, 2025 following a Karnataka High Court

  clear eligibility for high-tension and low-tension consumers with loads above
  100 kW,   establish a streamlined process for granting short-term and
  long-term open access, and formalize charges for transmission, wheeling,
  cross-subsidy, and banking. Short- term underutilization penalties, monthly
  banking settlement, and standby power arrangements are also detailed to ensure
  grid efficiency and cost recovery.
