Grid Controller of India issues the Procedure to implement uniform renewable energy tariff for the central pool of projects connected to interstate transmission systems (ISTS). The procedure was issued as a follow-up to the announcement in August last year when the Ministry of Power proposed establishing central pools of ISTS-connected renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hybrid, and storage.
