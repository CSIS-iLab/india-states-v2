Himachal Pradesh announces the “Mukhya Mantri Laghu Dukandar Kalyan Yojna” (MMLDKY) scheme aimed to offer collateral-free loans to small-scale enterprises and skill-based workers such as cobblers, tailors, barbers and vegetable vendors. The state government has earmarked $4.81 million for the loan and aims to target 75,000 individuals falling in the 18-55 age bracket in its initial phase.
