Karnataka waives arrears of $46.66 million of “Kuteera Bhagya”, “Bhagya Jyoti” and “Amruta Jyoti” scheme beneficiaries who were either getting power free of cost or at a highly subsidised rate. The three schemes have been merged as the “Gruha Jyoti” scheme under which beneficiaries are receiving free electricity up to 200 units for residential consumption.
