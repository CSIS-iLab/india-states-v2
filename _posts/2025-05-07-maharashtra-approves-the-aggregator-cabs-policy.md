title: "Maharashtra approves the Aggregator Cabs Policy, 2025 to regulate
  app-based ride-hailing services. The policy caps surge pricing at 1.5x the
  base fare and allows up to 25 percent discounts during oﬀ-peak hours.
  Cancellation penalties are standardized at $1.2 or 10 percent of the fare if
  cancelled by drivers, and $0.6 or 50 percent of the fare if cancelled by
  passengers—whichever is lower. GPS tracking and police verification have been
  made mandatory, and women-only carpooling is permitted. Drivers will retain 80
  percent of fares, while aggregators must set up local offices and oﬀer
  training, welfare benefits, and insurance support. "
