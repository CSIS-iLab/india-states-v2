Maharashtra imposes Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in Sangli and Satara districts amidst ensuing water scarcity due to lesser rainfall. Section 144 authorises the government to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area and is implemented as an anti-rioting provision.
