Union Cabinet approves the Readjustment of Representation of Scheduled Tribes Bill, 2024 to provide reservations to Scheduled Tribes in the Goa Legislative Assembly. The bill empowers the census commissioner to notify the population of STs in Goa, based on which, the Election Commission would amend the Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies Order, 2008, to make way for ST reservation in the Goa legislative assembly.
