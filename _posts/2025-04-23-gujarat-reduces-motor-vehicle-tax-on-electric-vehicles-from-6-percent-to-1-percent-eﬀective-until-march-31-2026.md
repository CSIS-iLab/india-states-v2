title: "Gujarat reduces motor vehicle tax on electric vehicles from 6 percent to
  1 percent, eﬀective until March 31, 2026. The move oﬀers EV buyers savings
  between $360 and $1,200, depending on vehicle cost. For example, a $12,000 EV
  now incurs just $120 in tax instead of $720. Online registration via the Vahan
  4.0 portal is required. The tax relief follows the rollback of earlier EV
  subsidies and aims to revive demand, with the   state targeting 200,000 EVs by
  2025, a 6 lakh tonne reduction in carbon emissions, and fuel savings of
  $600,000. "
