title: Kerala standardizes Working Hours for Hospitals. The new working hours of
  employees, including nurses, in all private hospitals across the state will be
  aligned with government-operated hospital shift systems. The Labor Department
  mandates a 6-6-12 hour shift system for all staﬀ, irrespective of the number
  of beds in a hospital. Employees working beyond their shift hours are entitled
  to overtime pay, applicable for up to 208 hours per month. Previously, the
  shift system applied only to private hospitals with more than 100 beds, with
  6-hour day shifts and 12-hour night shifts.
