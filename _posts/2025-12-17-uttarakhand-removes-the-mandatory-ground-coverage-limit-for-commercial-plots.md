title: Uttarakhand removes the Mandatory Ground Coverage Limit for Commercial
  Plots. The new rules allow for construction on 100 percent of the plot area
  after setbacks. Previously, the limit was capped at 75 percent. The state’s
  cabinet also approves changes to the Uttarakhand Town Planning Scheme and the
  Land Pooling Scheme to facilitate planned urban development and smooth land
  acquisition for special townships. To boost tourism, the government has
  relaxed land-use norms for resort development, including eco-resorts. Resorts
  may now be constructed directly on agricultural land, with minimum road width
  requirements reduced to six metres in hilly areas and nine metres in plains.
