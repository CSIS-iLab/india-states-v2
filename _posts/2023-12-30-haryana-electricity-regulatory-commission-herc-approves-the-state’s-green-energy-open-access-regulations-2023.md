Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) approves the state’s Green Energy Open Access Regulations, 2023. Consumers with a contracted demand or sanctioned load of at least 100 kW will be eligible for Green Energy Open Access, with no limit on the power supply for captive consumers. HERC issued the regulations in line with the Union government’s green energy open access rules introduced last year.
