Telangana amends its Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988, to allow shops to remain open 24Ã—7 in the state. To be eligible for the exemption, shops must fulfil certain conditions including providing their employees ID cards, weekly holidays, overtime wages, and ensuring adequate safety of female employees, among others.
