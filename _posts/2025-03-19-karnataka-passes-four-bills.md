Karnataka passes the Greater Bengaluru Governance Bill, 2024, amidst pushback from citizen groups. The bill proposes dividing the greater Bengaluru region in seven distinct corporations with the proposed Greater Bengaluru Authority leading the charge on overall planning. It also proposes cutting down the elected term of mayors, and deputy mayors from five to two and a half years. The bill aims to strengthen the administrative machinery of the city.
