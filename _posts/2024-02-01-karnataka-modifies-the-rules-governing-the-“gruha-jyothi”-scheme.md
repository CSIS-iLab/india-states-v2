Karnataka modifies the rules governing the “Gruha Jyothi” scheme, which provides free electricity for consumption up to 200 units. Under the modifications, the government has decided to eliminate the 10% additional subsidy on average usage and instead introduce an allocation of 10 extra free units, irrespective of usage, up to the 200-unit limit.
