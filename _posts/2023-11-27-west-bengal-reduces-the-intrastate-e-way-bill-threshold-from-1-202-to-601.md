West Bengal reduces the intrastate e-way bill threshold from $1,202 to $601, to bring parity with the rest of the country, and prevent Goods & Services Tax (GST) slippage. This means that an e-way bill will be required for the movement of goods valued at over $601 within the state. The provision will come into effect from December, 2023.
