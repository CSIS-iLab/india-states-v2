Odisha amends the Odisha Electric Vehicle Policy, 2021. Through this amendment, the government increases subsidies on the purchase of two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and four-wheeler electric vehicles. The state previously framed the EV policy in 2021 with an aim for adoption of 20 per cent electric vehicles by the end of 2025.
