title: West Bengal approves WBERC (Grid Interactive Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic
  System for Prosumers) Regulations, 2025. The regulations, approved by the West
  Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC) encourage the use of rooftop
  solar systems by consumers who can also act as producers, known as prosumers.
  These rules are designed to make it easier for people to generate their own
  electricity through solar power and, at the same time, use electricity from
  the grid.
