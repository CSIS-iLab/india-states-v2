title: Haryana introduces an additional day of free check-ups under the ‘Pradhan
  Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan’ (Prime Minister’s Scheme for Safe
  Pregnancies) (e-PMSMA). e-PMSMA provides comprehensive antenatal care services
  to pregnant women and focuses on the early detection and management of
  high-risk pregnancies (HRPs) through clinical examinations, diagnostics,
  medication, and counselling—and is provided free of charge at public health
  facilities. The new guidelines mandate four days a month for these free
  services, instead of the usual three.
