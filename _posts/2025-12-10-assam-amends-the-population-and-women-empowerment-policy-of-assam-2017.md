title: Assam amends the Population and Women Empowerment Policy of Assam, 2017.
  The policy had originally promoted a “two-child norm” for Scheduled Tribes,
  Scheduled Castes, and the Moran and Matak communities. These groups will now
  remain eligible for government employment, contesting elections, and receiving
  Self-Help Group (SHG) incentives under the new “three-child norm.”
