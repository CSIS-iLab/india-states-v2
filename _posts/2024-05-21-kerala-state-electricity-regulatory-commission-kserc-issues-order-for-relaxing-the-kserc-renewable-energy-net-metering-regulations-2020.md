Kerala State Electricity Regulatory Commission (KSERC) issues order for relaxing the KSERC (Renewable Energy & Net metering) Regulations, 2020. The move is aimed at ensuring smoother implementation of the PM-KUSUM scheme which seeks to solarize agricultural pumps. The relaxation applies to Individual Pump Solarisation (IPS) under Component-C of PM-KUSUM which benefits individual farmers who own grid-connected agriculture pumps.
