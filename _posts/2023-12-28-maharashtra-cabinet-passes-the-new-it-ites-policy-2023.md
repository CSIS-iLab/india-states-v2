Maharashtra cabinet passes the new IT-ITES Policy 2023 aimed at further developing the information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services sector. The objective of the new policy is to attract investments worth $11.5 billion, reach exports of $12.13 billion, and create 3.5 million jobs. The policy offers 50 to 100% subsidy in the stamp duty and waives off electricity charges from 10 to 15 years.
